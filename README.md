# Travellist_startupProject1

This is an app based on material design fundamental from https://www.raywenderlich.com/103367/material-design
I learned basics of material design from https://www.raywenderlich.com/103367/material-design
So if you want to learn it Please checkout the full tutorial in https://www.raywenderlich.com/103367/material-design .
And download the startup project from there and follow the documentation instructions.

Noted: I corrected some useless methods, so if you have any trouble with that website documentation please check and find the solution in my this repo.

Happy coding... :)
